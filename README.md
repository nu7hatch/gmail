# Gmail for Ruby

A Rubyesque interface to Google's GMail, with all the tools you'll need. 
Search, read and send multipart emails, archive, mark as read/unread, delete 
emails, and manage labels.

It's based on [nu7hatch's gmail](http://github.com/nu7hatch/gmail), which 
based on
[Daniel Parker's ruby-gmail gem](https://github.com/dcparker/ruby-gmail). I 
tried to make some changes in structure of these components but then broke the 
compatibility with the old version. I will try to keep API changes minimal.

This version has better internal structure, IMO, though. I have also 
implemented an idea which enable support for Gmail in different languages than 
English. There are still many things to be done (and tested).

## Installation

You can install it easy using rubygems:

    sudo gem install gmail

Or install it manualy:

    git clone git://github.com/ducngtuan/gmail.git
    cd gmail
    rake install

To install gmail gem you have to met following requirements (with rubygems all 
will be installed automatically):

* mail
* mime
* smpt_tls (Ruby < 1.8.7)

## Features

* Search emails
* Read emails (handles attachments)
* Emails: label, archive, delete, mark as read/unread/spam, star
* Manage labels
* Create and send multipart email messages in plaintext and/or html, with 
  inline images and attachments
* Utilizes Gmail's IMAP & SMTP, MIME-type detection and parses and generates 
  MIME properly.

## Basic usage

First of all require the `gmail` library.

    require 'gmail'
    
### Authenticating gmail sessions

This will you automatically log in to your account. 

    gmail = Gmail.connect(username, password)
    # play with your gmail...
    gmail.logout

If you pass a block, the session will be passed into the block, and the session will be logged out after the block is executed.

    Gmail.connect(username, password) do |gmail|
      # play with your gmail...
    end
    
Examples above are "quiet", it means that it will not raise any errors when 
session couldn't be started (eg. because of connection error or invalid 
authorization data). You can use connection which handles errors raising:

    Gmail.connect!(username, password)
    Gmail.connect!(username, password) {|gmail| ... play with gmail ... }
    
You can also check if you are logged in at any time:

    Gmail.connect(username, password) do |gmail|
      gmail.logged_in?
    end

### XOAuth authentication

From v0.4.0 it's possible to authenticate with your Gmail account using XOAuth
method. It's very simple:

    gmail = Gmail.connect(:xoauth, "email@domain.com", 
      :token           => 'TOKEN',
      :secret          => 'TOKEN_SECRET',
      :consumer_key    => 'CONSUMER_KEY',
      :consumer_secret => 'CONSUMER_SECRET'
    )
    
For more information check out the [gmail_xoauth](https://github.com/nfo/gmail_xoauth)
gem from Nicolas Fouché.

### Counting and gathering emails
    
Get counts for messages in the inbox:

    gmail.inbox.count
    gmail.inbox.count(:unread)
    gmail.inbox.count(:read)

Count with some criteria:

    gmail.inbox.count(:after => Date.parse("2010-02-20"), :before => Date.parse("2010-03-20"))
    gmail.inbox.count(:on => Date.parse("2010-04-15"))
    gmail.inbox.count(:from => "myfriend@gmail.com")
    gmail.inbox.count(:to => "directlytome@gmail.com")

Combine flags and options:

    gmail.inbox.count(:unread, :from => "myboss@gmail.com")
    
Browsing labeled emails is similar to work with inbox.

    gmail.mailbox('Urgent').count
    
Getting messages works the same way as counting: Remember that every message 
in a conversation/thread will come as a separate message.

    gmail.inbox.emails(:unread, :before => Date.parse("2010-04-20"), :from => "myboss@gmail.com")

You can use also one of aliases:

    gmail.inbox.find(...)
    gmail.inbox.search(...)
    gmail.inbox.mails(...)    
    
Also you can manipulate each message using block style:

    gmail.inbox.find(:unread) do |email|
      email.read!
    end
    
### Working with emails!

Any news older than 4-20, mark as read and archive it:

    gmail.inbox.find(:before => Date.parse("2010-04-20"), :from => "news@nbcnews.com") do |email|
      email.read! # can also unread!, spam! or star!
      email.archive!
    end

Delete emails from X:

    gmail.inbox.find(:from => "x-fiance@gmail.com").each do |email|
      email.delete!
    end

Save all attachments in the "Faxes" label to a local folder:

    folder = "/where/ever"
    gmail.mailbox("Faxes").emails do |email|
      if !email.message.attachments.empty?
        email.message.save_attachments_to(folder)
      end
    end
     
You can use also `#label` method instead of `#mailbox`: 

    gmail.label("Faxes").emails {|email| ... }

Save just the first attachment from the newest unread email (assuming pdf):

    email = gmail.inbox.find(:unread).first
    email.attachments[0].save_to_file("/path/to/location")

Add a label to a message:

    email.label("Faxes")
    
Example above will raise error when you don't have the `Faxes` label. You can 
avoid this using:

    email.label!("Faxes") # The `Faxes` label will be automatically created now

You can also move message to a label/mailbox:
 
    email.move_to("Faxes")
    email.move_to!("NewLabel")
    
There is also few shortcuts to mark messages quickly:

    email.read!
    email.unread!
    email.spam!
    email.star!
    email.unstar!

### Managing labels (deprecated)

This section is **deprecated**. See Managing Mailboxes. The old codes, 
however, still function.

With Gmail gem you can also manage your labels. You can get list of defined 
labels:

    gmail.labels.all

Create new label:

    gmail.labels.create("Uregent")
    gmail.labels.add("AnotherOne")

Remove labels:

    gmail.labels.delete("Uregent")
    gmail.labels.remove("AnotherOne")

Or check if given label exists:

    gmail.labels.exists?("Uregent") # => false
    gmail.labels.exists?("AnotherOne") # => true

### Managing Mailboxes

Gmail gem defined some standard mailboxes so you can find the mailbox quite 
easy. The standard mailboxes are `inbox`, `all_mail`, `drafts`, `trash`, `sent_mail`, `importance`, `starred` and `spam`.

    gmail.inbox
    gmail.all_mail.count

To get list of all mailboxes:

    gmail.all_mailboxes # Array of all Gmail::Mailbox objects
    gmail.all_labels    # Array of all mailboxes' name

To create a mailbox:

    gmail.mailbox("New mailbox") # not work with gmail.mailbox!
    gmail.add("AnotherOne")
    gmail.create("Some other")

Delete a mailboxes:

    gmail.delete("Some boxes")
    gmail.remove("AnotherOne")

Standard mailboxes like `inbox` or `spam` cannot be deleted.

### Composing and sending emails

Creating emails now uses the amazing [Mail](http://rubygems.org/gems/mail) 
rubygem. See its [documentation here](http://github.com/mikel/mail). The Ruby 
Gmail will automatically configure your Mail emails to be sent via your Gmail 
account's SMTP, so they will be in your Gmail's "Sent" folder. Also, no need 
to specify the "From" email either, because ruby-gmail will set it for you.

    gmail.deliver do
      to "email@example.com"
      subject "Having fun in Puerto Rico!"
      text_part do
        body "Text of plaintext message."
      end
      html_part do
        body "<p>Text of <em>html</em> message.</p>"
      end
      add_file "/path/to/some_image.jpg"
    end

Or, compose the message first and send it later

    email = gmail.compose do
      to "email@example.com"
      subject "Having fun in Puerto Rico!"
      body "Spent the day on the road..."
    end
    email.deliver! # or: gmail.deliver(email)

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a 
  commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
